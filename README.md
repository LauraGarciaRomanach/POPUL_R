# POPUL-R, a Shiny app designed to explore the *Populus* transcriptome throughout a yearly growth cycle
This app is based on a RNA-Seq dataset we have obtained from different poplar tissues in outdoor and indoor conditions, published in Marcon et. al (2025). In POPUL-R, you can perform exploratory analyses on your genes of interest, such as visualizing their expression profiles, identifying other genes with similar expression patterns, and exploring the biological processes they may be involved in. 

The app can be found [here](https://popul-r.serve.scilifelab.se/app/popul-r).

## Content
This repository contains the code of the Shiny app in the [`app`](app) directory, and the data preparation scripts in the [`src/R`](src/R) directory.The full data analysis pipeline can be found in the repository [nicolasDelhomme/aspen-FT-compendium](https://github.com/nicolasDelhomme/aspen-FT-compendium).
